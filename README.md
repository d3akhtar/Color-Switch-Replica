A replica of the popular mobile game Color Switch, done entirely in Unity. The goal of this project was to replicate the main gameplay, and add some of the obstacles. I didn't add every single type of obstacle and multiple modes and color schemes like the original, as it wasn't my goal to replicate absolutely everything about the game.

HOW TO PLAY:

You are a ball that keeps jumping upwards while avoiding obstacles. Press "E" to jump, and "Esc" to pause. Stars are how you will gather points, while the colorful spheres will the change the color of the ball. To get past obstacles, make sure you pass avoid hitting the parts of the obstacle that are different from the color of your ball, as this will be game over!

This is the first project I've done mostly on my own, meaning I didn't rely on a tutorial for majority of the development phase. However, for certain features or bugs, I did search up small tutorials to help implement these features or fix certain bugs. 

The main goal of this project was for me to get experience programming something on my own. I like games, so naturally, creating games is the best way for me to motivate myself to program. After this project, I have began to learn other skills and languages, such as using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a webpage, and using SQL to interact with databases. The confidence to try all of those things out began from the completion of this project, so while it is a simple project, it is something I am very proud of completing.
